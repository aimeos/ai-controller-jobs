	/** controller/jobs/index/optimize/name
	 * Class name of the used catalog index optimize scheduler controller implementation
	 *
	 * Each default job controller can be replace by an alternative imlementation.
	 * To use this implementation, you have to set the last part of the class
	 * name as configuration value so the controller factory knows which class it
	 * has to instantiate.
	 *
	 * For example, if the name of the default class is
	 *
	 *  \Aimeos\Controller\Jobs\Index\Optimize\Standard
	 *
	 * and you want to replace it with your own version named
	 *
	 *  \Aimeos\Controller\Jobs\Index\Optimize\Myoptimizer
	 *
	 * then you have to set the this configuration option:
	 *
	 *  controller/index/optimize/name = Myoptimizer
	 *
	 * The value is the last part of your own class name and it's case sensitive,
	 * so take care that the configuration value is exactly named like the last
	 * part of the class name.
	 *
	 * The allowed characters of the class name are A-Z, a-z and 0-9. No other
	 * characters are possible! You should always start the last part of the class
	 * name with an upper case character and continue only with lower case characters
	 * or numbers. Avoid chamel case names like "MyOptimizer"!
	 *
	 * @param string Last part of the class name
	 * @since 2014.03

	/** controller/jobs/index/optimize/decorators/excludes
	 * Excludes decorators added by the "common" option from the catalog index optimize controllers
	 *
	 * Decorators extend the functionality of a class by adding new aspects
	 * (e.g. log what is currently done), executing the methods of the underlying
	 * class only in certain conditions (e.g. only for logged in users) or
	 * modify what is returned to the caller.
	 *
	 * This option allows you to remove a decorator added via
	 * "controller/jobs/common/decorators/default" before they are wrapped
	 * around the job controller.
	 *
	 *  controller/jobs/index/optimize/decorators/excludes = array( 'decorator1' )
	 *
	 * This would remove the decorator named "decorator1" from the list of
	 * common decorators ("\Aimeos\Controller\Jobs\Common\Decorator\*") added via
	 * "controller/jobs/common/decorators/default" to this job controller.
